This project aims at analyzing the impact of the Paris Agreement and other policies on CO2 emission levels.

Data Analysis Techniques: Data Cleaning; Visualizations; Web Scraping.

Statistical Methods: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression; Difference-in-Difference Model; Machine Learning Techniques.

Conclusion: More developed countries exhibit a greater decrease in emissions post-policy enactment, supported by empirical analysis and regression models.
